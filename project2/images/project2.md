# Setup

The project is compiled with `Apple clang version 14.0.0`.
All tests are performed on a 2021 MacBook Pro with Apple M1 Pro CPU (ARM) with default resolution 1600x1200 (unless otherwise specified).

# Overview

In this assignment, by finishing the first two sections, we investigated several topics such as Bezier curves and surfaces using the de Casteljau algorithm, half-edge data structure, and loop subdivision. In this writeup, we will explain each algorithm we discovered and elaborate on how the details are implemented.

# Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces
## Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision
## Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau

# Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure
## Part 3:  Area-Weighted Vertex Normals
## Part 4: Edge Flip
## Part 5: Edge Split
## Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling
